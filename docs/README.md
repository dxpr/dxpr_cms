# Demo Documentation

The docs here are incomplete, and are not currently intended for public consumption. Rather, they are an example of what an eventual DXPR CMS Guide might look like and a place to start working out an outline and formatting conventions.

There are three example pages that document a sub-set of the Events recipe's features:

- [Concept: Events](./features/events/events--overview.md)
- [Create a Single Event](./features/events/events--create-single.md)
- [Create a Recurring Event](./features/events/events--create--recurring.md)

## Conventions

Any text that appears in the user interface is formatted in italics and should be written exactly as it appears in the interface.

Examples:

```md
Choose the _Extend_ option from the navigation.

Check the box for the _Block content_ module then scroll to the bottom of the page and press the _Save_ button.

Select the _Add another item_ button.
```

Stubbed links are enclosed by square brackets and point to a non-existent /bad-links.md file. This consistency makes them easier to find, and fix, later.

Example:

```md
[this is a link](/bad-link.md)
```

## Guide content types

Types of content in the guide:

### Concepts

- Illuminate a specific topic with background knowledge, term definitions, and examples.
- Provide an overview of the use cases for a feature, helping the learner envision how they might solve their own problems.
- Discuss what tacos are, rather than a step-by-step recipe for how to make a taco.

### Tasks / Tutorials

- Provide step-by-step instructions on how to complete a specific task.
- Learning-oriented, especially learning by doing.
- Focus on learning _how_ rather than learning _what_.
- Help a learner understand how to accomplish a task, and gain confidence in applying the skills to their own specific use case.
