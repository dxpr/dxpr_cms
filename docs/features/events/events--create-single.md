# Create a Single Event

## Summary

Learn to create one-off events like a meeting or a party. Start by creating and previewing an event draft. When everything looks good, publish the event, and share it with the world.

## Goal

Publish a new single occurrence event.

## Prerequisites

The Events feature must be enabled. If this was not done when the site was initially created, enable it before continuing. Learn more in [Enabling a New Feature](/bad-link.md).

## How to create and publish one-off events

!!! note "Tip"

  If you create the same event more than once, save time by [creating a recurring event](./events--create-recurring.md).

### Create an event draft

1. In the _Administration Toolbar_ navigate to _Create_ > _Event_ (_/admin/event_).

   <!-- ðŸ“¸Screenshot: Cropped screenshot of admin toolbar showing where to find add an event in the menu. -->
   ![Admin toolbar expanded to show "Create" section with "Event" highlighted.](./images/create-event-menu.png)

1. Fill in the _Create Event_ form with the details for your event.

   **Title:** Enter a name for the event.

   **When:** Enter the dates and times for when the event begins and ends. Or choose *All day* for events that donâ€™t have a specific time. For single occurrence events, enter *Repeats: never*.

   Tip: For events that happen more than once, but donâ€™t follow any specific recurring pattern like weekly, or every 2nd Monday, you can add additional single dates for the same event by selecting the _Add another item_ option.

   **Where:** Choose a location for the event from the list of available locations. To add new locations to the list see [Add a Location](/bad-link.md).

   **Body:** Add a detailed description of the event. The description can include formatted text, images, and other media. Learn more about how to [use the DXPR CMS text editor](/bad-link.md) and [manage media](/bad-link.md).

   By default, a trimmed version of the description is used on the Events listing page. For more control over the content of the summary, select the *Edit summary* link and fill in the *Summary* field.

1. In the editor sidebar, the Eventâ€™s _Current state_ will default to _Draft_. Leave it as _Draft_ to save the event as a draft. Or, set _Change to_ to _Published_ if youâ€™re ready to publish the event. Draft events are only viewable by editors. Once published, the event will become available to the public.

1. Select the _Save_ button.

### Publish an event

After creating a draft of the event and previewing the content to ensure it looks correct, publish your event to share it with the world.

To publish an event:

1. In the _Administration Toolbar_, navigate to _Content_ (_/admin/content_).
1. Filter the list to display _Content type: Events_ and _Published status: Draft_.
1. Find the event in the list and select the _Edit_ button.
1. In the sidebar, the _Current status_ should be _Draft_. Set _Change to_ to _Published_.
1. Select the _Save_ button.

Your event is now available to the public and can be found on your siteâ€™s _Events_ listing and _Calendar_ pages.

## FAQs

- Q: Can I share the drafts I created with other editors?

  A: Yes.
- Q: Can I change a published event back to a draft?

  A: No. But you can create a new draft version of an event with edits that need to be reviewed. Or, you can remove an event from your public website by changing its status to _Archived_. Learn more about [publishing workflows](/bad-link.md).
