## Future-proof your digital strategy with scalable tools for efficient content management

Welcome to DXPR CMS, a dynamic Drupal distribution that simplifies complex content management challenges. Designed to enhance productivity, ensure data security, and leverage the potential of AI, this platform integrates tools like [DXPR Builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_builder) and [DXPR Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_theme), alongside cutting-edge AI modules to empower users, streamline workflows, and reduce operational costs.

## Key features of DXPR CMS

### DXPR Builder: empowering content management

[DXPR Builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_builder) is an intuitive drag-and-drop page builder that allows users of all technical levels to create engaging, mobile-responsive web pages effortlessly. While it does not yet integrate AI features, it remains a key part of our CMS, streamlining content creation and management with minimal backend involvement.

### DXPR Theme: simplifying customization

The [DXPR Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_theme) offers a visual interface that enables developers to swiftly align site design with organizational branding guidelines. Although it doesn't yet feature AI integrations, it minimizes time spent on styling and enhances site functionality, promoting consistent brand identity across digital assets.

### AI-first features: a new approach to content management

DXPR CMS distinguishes itself by offering AI-powered assistance directly within the user interface. Unlike other platforms that rely on cramped sidebars or popup tools, we make AI a central part of the content creation experience. Our AI modules enhance productivity and usability without distraction.

## AI-enhanced content management modules

### AI Image Alt Text

The [AI Image Alt Text](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai_image_alt_text) module automatically generates alt texts for images using AI vision models. Integrated with image widgets, it exposes a button for authorized users to generate alt texts, supporting alt text creation in the language of the entity.

### AI Views Sorting (coming soon)

The [AI Views Sorting](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai_sorting) module introduces an AI-based sorting plugin for Drupal Views. Using the UCB2 algorithm, it ranks and displays content dynamically based on user engagement metrics. This feature will be a powerful tool for improving content relevance and discovery over time.

### Analyze Module (coming soon)

The [Analyze Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/analyze) provides an API framework for adding content-related information to Drupal entities. Its "Analyze" tab serves as a unified interface where other modules can display their analysis results.

### AI Security Analyze (coming soon)

AI-powered security analysis helps detect in-content security threats such as malicious links or PII disclosure. By scanning content in real-time, this module mitigates risks during the content creation process and enhances overall security.

### AI Sentiment Analysis (coming soon)

The AI Sentiment Analysis feature provides real-time content analysis to identify emotional tones such as joy, anger, or neutrality. This will allow content editors to gauge the emotional impact of their content and make adjustments accordingly.

### AI CKEditor Assistant (coming soon)

The AI CKEditor Assistant will introduce generative AI capabilities into CKEditor via a slash command interface. Users will be able to prompt the AI to generate content, perform corrections, or provide enhancementsâ€”all within the CKEditor environment. This tool will make content creation faster and smarter.
